To customise this file to reflect your config
  - list your audio device with 'aplay -l | grep card'
  - Find your device name the one between [] example [Jabra SOLEMATE v1.34.0]
  - Find your device ID (word right after ':') example v1340

1) Copy this template into /usr/share/alsa/ucm
2) Rename to reflect your sound card name e.g. 'Jabra SOLEMATE v1.34.0'
3) Rename Entry config file to CardName.conf e.g. 'Jabra SOLEMATE v1.34.0.conf'

Note: 
 1) UCM does not define any default convention for board name. Nevertheless as
    AGL audio agent translate devid to board name to open UCM. When using AGL user
    should apply naming convention to SoundCardName.
 2) Command will stop at 1st error. You should have a working card to apply test
 3) SoftVol are only visible after 1st usage. Test with "amixer -D hw:xxxx contents"
    to make sure that your added controls are visible for your targeted board.

Testing your config:
  
  - list configure verbs
    alsaucm -c "Jabra SOLEMATE" list _verbs

  - set a usecase
    alsaucm -c "Jabra SOLEMATE"  set _verb HiFi

  - get a value (note as alsaucm does not have session set/get should be in the command)
    alsaucm -c "Jabra SOLEMATE"  set _verb HiFi get "OutputDspName//"
